# FileXpress

**FileXpress** is a simple and efficient file-sharing application. It allows you to upload files and host a local web server so that other devices on the same network can easily download those files via a browser.

## 🌟Features
- **Local File Hosting**: Share files directly from your device by hosting a web server.
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Files can be downloaded from any device with a web browser.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Minimal and intuitive design for quick sharing.
- **Privacy Focused**: No data is sent to external servers; everything stays within your local network.

## 🚀How It Works
1. **Select Files**: Choose the files you want to share.
2. **Start Hosting**: The app generates a local web link.
3. **Share the Link**: Other devices on the same Wi-Fi can access the files by opening the link in their browser.
